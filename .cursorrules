# Workspace Rules

## 🧠 Behavior & Workflow
- **Plan First**: Prefer "Plan mode" over autonomous execution for complex changes.
- **Use Prompts**: The primary workflows are defined in `.agent/workflows/*.md`. Always check these for specific task instructions (e.g., planning, refactoring).
- **Consult Specs**: Always refer to `/docs` for architectural decisions before inventing behavior.

## 💻 Coding Standards
- **Functions**: Keep them small (20-50 lines), focused on a single responsibility.
- **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names.
- **Comments**: Add minimal but useful comments ONLY where intent is non-obvious.
- **Style**: Preserve the existing style of files when editing.
- **Diffs**: Return minimal patches with context; avoid unrelated changes.
- **Dependencies**: Use the standardized package manager for the project (e.g., `pip`/.venv for Python, `npm`/`pnpm` for Node).
- **No Magic**: Do not invent new build steps; use existing `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, or `Makefile` scripts.

## 📚 Documentation
- **Locations**:
  - Technical Specs: `/docs/technical/`
  - Architecture: `/docs/decisions/`
  - Plans: `/docs/plans/`
  - **Project Management**: `/docs/project-management/` (Summaries, retrospectives)
- **Conventions**:
  - Use `kebab-case` or `snake_case` for filenames.
  - Include purpose, owner, and date in headers.

## 🤖 LLM Preferences
- **Model**: `gemini-2.0-flash` (preferred for cost/speed).
- **Embeddings**: `text-embedding-004`.
